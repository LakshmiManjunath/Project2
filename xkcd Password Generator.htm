<div class="info">
	<p><b>xkcd</b>, created by Randall Munroe, is a webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language. The subject matter of the comic varies from statements on life &amp; love to mathematical &amp; scientific jokes.</p>
	<p class="image"><a href="http://xkcd.com/936/"><img src="./xkcd Password Generator_files/password_strength.png" alt="password_strength"></a> </p>
	<p class="xkcd_info">This comic is saying that the password in the first frame "Tr0ub4dor&amp;3" is easier for password cracking software to guess because it has less entropy than "correcthorsebatterystaple" and also more difficult for a human to remember, leading to insecure practices like writing the password down on a post-it attached to the monitor.<br>
	In simple cases the entropy of a password is calculated as a^b where 'a' is the number of allowed symbols and 'b' is its length. A dictionary word (however long) has an entropy of around 65000, i.e. 16 bits. A truly random string of length 11 (not like "Tr0ub4dor&amp;3", but more like "J4I/tyJ&amp;Acy") has 94^11 = 72.1 bits. However the comic shows that "Tr0ub4dor&amp;3" has only 28 bits of entropy. Another way of selecting a password is to have 2048 "symbols" (common words) and select only 4 of those symbols. 2048^4 = 44 bits, much better than 28.<br>
	The important thing to take away from this comic is that longer passwords are better because each additional character adds much more time to the breaking of the password. Complexity does not matter unless you have length in passwords. Complexity is more difficult for humans to remember, but length is not.
